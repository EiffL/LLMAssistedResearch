My attempt at using ChatGPT to accelerate a research project. 
An open source scientific article created using the [showyourwork](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork) workflow.

Here is the question: *using ChatGPT, how long would it take to go from a rough idea to a ready-to-submit paper?*


**Note**: I am not taking sides on the question "should we use these models to write papers?" I am interested in the question "*can* we use these models to write papers?", and by that I mean can they be helpful to do science. I am absolutely not interested in completely automatically writing a paper from the title and list of authors (which it could do, but that wouldn't be very convincing if an expert read it), but whether you can write a paper by having a conversation with it and guiding it towards what you want.
